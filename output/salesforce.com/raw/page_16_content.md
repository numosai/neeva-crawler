###  What is a CRM in education?

###  What is the difference between a CRM and LMS? 
CRM is a technology for managing your institution's relationships and interactions with students. Salesforce for Education is a CRM. An LMS is a learning management system for the administration and delivery of courses. LMS data can easily be brought into a CRM for a unified view of every student.
###  How can a CRM for Education help my school?

###  What is the best Education CRM? 
Institutions of all sizes trust Salesforce for Education to not only deliver exceptional constituent experiences but also to increase staff productivity at scale. In fact, Forrester Consulting highlighted the benefits and ROI of Salesforce for Education for a variety of institutions in this [research](https://www.salesforce.com/form/sfdo/edu/forrester-tei-edu-2023/?d=pb).
###  How do I choose the right CRM for Education? 
When comparing CRMs, consider whether the solution has the integrations and customizations you're looking for, a reputable user experience and ROI, trusted customer support, and if the solution can grow with your needs. Outline your pain points, compare features, and explore key references.
###  How does Salesforce support the Education community? 
Salesforce supports Education through technology and philanthropic giving. We help institutions of all sizes thrive via our grants program, Trailhead, and community resources. We're also focused on reducing barriers to learning and the workforce. Learn more about our commitment to Education [here](https://www.salesforce.com/company/commitment-to-education/).

##  Your business can make an impact. 
Salesforce is a different kind of company. Our founders created the 1-1-1 model, which commits 1% of our equity, technology, and our employees’ time to build a more equitable and sustainable world. We’re also a founder and champion of Pledge 1%, a global movement to ensure giving back is part of companies of all sizes.

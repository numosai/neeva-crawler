##  Agentforce Frequently Asked Questions 
###  What is an AI agent? 
[AI Agents](https://www.salesforce.com/agentforce/ai-agents/) are autonomous, proactive applications designed to execute specialized tasks to help employees and customers.

These agents generate responses that are consistent with your company’s brand voice and guidelines using trusted business data, including [Salesforce CRM](https://www.salesforce.com/crm/) data, external data from [Data Cloud](https://www.salesforce.com/data/), and more. These agents are capable of operating 24/7 across various platforms like self-service portals and messaging channels, handling tasks proactively within set guardrails.

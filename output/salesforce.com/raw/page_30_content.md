### Questions about Salesforce+? We have answers.
##### What is Salesforce+?
Salesforce+ is the free streaming service for business. It’s a place to watch live events that help you grow your career and company, on your own time. Salesforce+ is produced by Salesforce, so you’ll find our company’s big events like Dreamforce here — as well as virtual learning made for your role and industry. Everything is free and unlimited.
##### What can I watch on Salesforce+?
You can watch all kinds of helpful, entertaining, and inspiring videos on Salesforce+. One thing our members love is our events. Whether you catch them live or on demand, Salesforce+ gives you a free front-row seat to our biggest global events, like Dreamforce, TDX, Tableau Conference, and Connections. These entertaining business shows star people in roles and industries just like yours, giving you fresh ideas for how to grow your company and do better work. The best part is, it’s all free.
##### Do I have to pay for Salesforce+?
Salesforce+ is free. Watch any Salesforce+ events or series at no cost. To enjoy unlimited free access to our entire library of videos, become a member by signing up for Salesforce+ with a Trailblazer account. To join us for virtual events like Dreamforce or Connections, you need to create your own Trailblazer account (it’s free!).
##### What is a Trailblazer account?
Your Trailblazer account gives you access to a unified profile across the Salesforce ecosystem and allows you to manage your settings and access across multiple Salesforce sites.
##### How do I sign up to register for live and on-demand events, like Dreamforce?
Sign up or log in to your Trailblazer account and complete a few additional details to watch Salesforce+ events live and on demand. We recommend preregistering for all events on Salesforce+ to get your own personalized journey, reminders, recommendations, and more.
##### Do I need to be a Salesforce customer to watch Salesforce+?
You don’t need to be a Salesforce customer to watch Salesforce+. Our virtual learning is open to everyone.

#  Salesforce is an Agentic Enterprise. 
As Customer Zero, we put Agentforce to work on our own toughest challenges — from scaling service to fueling growth. And we’ve seen real results — millions of support cases closed, 15% more marketing pipeline, and 80% higher lead conversion. See how we did it – and how you can, too.

##  Unified data brings us closer to our customers. 
Using Data 360 to unify all our data, it became instantly actionable across all our apps and workflows as well as in Agentforce. Unlocking previously siloed data gives us a 360-degree view of every customer across their entire journey, so we can offer highly personalized experiences at scale.

##  Agents get reps from lead to close faster. 
With Agentforce, easily launched on Slack, CRM, or mobile, questions that once took hours to answer are now resolved in minutes, like “How’s my pipeline health?” or “Which accounts should I focus on next — and why?” Competitive intelligence and product details are right at reps’ fingertips and account plans can be created in a fraction of the time. An agent even helps sellers rehearse and refine pitches.

##  Agents focus on the leads reps can’t. 
Our Lead Nurturing Agent automatically nurtures low-scoring inbound leads around the clock with personalized email outreach. When interest is detected, Agentforce reaches out to schedule a meeting with a human sales rep — so now, not a single lead is left behind.

##  Our Help Agent sheds the bot mentality. 
We set a goal of making self-service so effective, users wouldn’t need to file support tickets, regardless of case complexity. Our phased rollout for Agentforce let us refine along the way, and we’ve now increased self-serve resolution by over 10%, reducing case volume and greatly improving the customer experience.

##  Better answers served up faster. 
Unsatisfied with the limitations of our legacy, rule-based chatbot, we launched a web agent to transform the experience on Salesforce.com. The agent lets users ask conversational questions and get accurate, detailed product answers in seconds. It also employs intelligent reasoning to determine when qualified leads should be transferred to a sales rep.

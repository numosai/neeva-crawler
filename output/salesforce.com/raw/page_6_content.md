##  Agentforce Frequently Asked Questions 
###  What is an AI agent? 
[AI Agents](https://www.salesforce.com/agentforce/ai-agents/) are autonomous, proactive applications designed to execute specialized tasks to help employees and customers.

These agents generate responses that are consistent with your companyâ€™s brand voice and guidelines using trusted business data, including [Salesforce CRM](https://www.salesforce.com/crm/) data, external data from [Data Cloud](https://www.salesforce.com/data/), and more. These agents are capable of operating 24/7 across various platforms like self-service portals and messaging channels, handling tasks proactively within set guardrails.

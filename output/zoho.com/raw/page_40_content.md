##  What makes Zoho’s approach to AI unique?
Our shared data model, owned and managed tech stack, and broad application portfolio are our greatest assets in building a stable, flexible AI platform.
### Breadth of Zoho’s AI offerings

###  Depth of Zoho’s in-house tech stack
Unlike many other AI providers, Zoho owns all layers of our technology stack—from the data center infrastructure up through the application layer.

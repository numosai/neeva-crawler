"It was a very interactive class. It illustrated areas where we're really on track in using the tool for its highest and best use. And it also illustrated areas where we could actually use more of the tool for our scalability and for our sales team and marketing team to really take advantage of the enhancements that they've recently added."

"This training really helped fill in some of the gaps in our understanding of Zoho and how powerful it is. And we're looking at putting some new things in place, for example, configuring our email system with Zoho, using some automation for following up leads and quotations, and there's so many different opportunities, and it's really helped to broaden our understanding of how powerful Zoho is and what it can be doing for our organization."

## Frequently asked questions?
### What are the training programs available for Zoho products? 
We offer two types of training - Virtual classrooms and one-on-one online training. Virtual classrooms happen after finalising a schedule which is published in our upcoming training page and users can register for a session that is convenient for them. This training will have users from multiple organisations present. Whereas, the one-on-one training happens upon a customer's request and at a time convenient for them. This training will have users (one or more) from a single organisation only.
### Which one is suitable for me? 
It's advisable to go through the agenda and decide which type of training will be suitable for you. While we do encourage asking questions during both types of training, if you're a person who will want to clarify in-depth product related and business related queries clarified privately, it's advisable to go for a one-on- training. If not, you can attend one of our virtual classroom sessions, where the trainer will allow trainees to ask questions after each topic and clarify it before moving on to the next topic.
### What is the difference between online training and virtual classrooms? 
#### Virtual or Classroom?
Our online training program is based on requests from users and is scheduled depending on the user and trainer's availability. It is a one-on-one session, and trainers only handle one organization at a time. Virtual classrooms, on the other hand, are scheduled beforehand and listed on this page, where users can select a convenient slot for them based on their time zone. This will be an instructor-led, online session where the trainees can all see the trainer and interact with each other. Users from different organizations will take part in virtual classroom sessions.

##  1. Responsible Salesforce entity 
Salesforce, Inc. and/or its affiliated entities (“Salesforce, “we”, “us”, or the “Company”) are responsible for the processing of your Personal Data as described in this Privacy Statement, unless specified otherwise, and act as the controller of such Personal Data. A list of Salesforce’s affiliates can be found in the List of Subsidiaries section of Salesforce’s most recent Form 10-K, available under the SEC Filings tab by selecting the “Annual Filings” filter on the page located [here](https://investor.salesforce.com/financials/sec-filings/default.aspx).
This Privacy Statement does not apply to the extent we process Personal Data as a processor or service provider on behalf of our customers, including where we offer to our customers various services through which our customers (or their affiliates): (i) create their own websites and applications running on our platforms; (ii) sell or offer their own products and services; (iii) send electronic communications to others; or (iv) otherwise collect, use, share or process Personal Data via our services.
For detailed privacy information related to a Salesforce customer or a customer affiliate who uses Salesforce services as the controller, please contact our customer directly. We are not responsible for the privacy or data security practices of our customers, which may differ from those explained in this Privacy Statement. For more information, please also see Section 10.3 below.
##  2. When this Privacy Statement applies 
This Privacy Statement applies to the processing of Personal Data collected by us when you:
• Visit or interact with our websites that display or link to this Privacy Statement;
• Visit or interact with our branded social media pages;
• Visit our offices or other premises;
• Receive communications from us or otherwise communicate with us, including but not limited to emails, phone calls, texts or faxes;
• Use our services where we act as a controller of your Personal Data;
• Register for, attend or take part in our events, webinars, programs, trainings, certifications or contests;
• Act as or work for a service provider or supplier to Salesforce, to the extent Salesforce acts as a controller with respect to your Personal Data;
• Are employed by a customer using our services where your Personal Data has been shared with us in our capacity as a controller (for example, during the sales or contracting process);
• Participate in a Salesforce community, such as that focused on open source development; or
• Participate in surveys, research or other similar data collection facilitated by us.
We also host several online marketplaces such as:
• AppExchange, which is an online marketplace for on-demand web applications that run on the Salesforce platform and that may be provided by us or by third parties (see <https://appexchange.salesforce.com/>), and
• Tableau’s Extension Gallery (<https://extensiongallery.tableau.com>) which offers connectors and solutions that provide additional functionality for Tableau, such as dashboard extensions.
When applications, connectors, extensions or other solutions are provided by us and they link to this Privacy Statement, this Privacy Statement applies. When these offerings are provided by third parties, the privacy statement of the relevant third party applies and this Privacy Statement does not.
Our websites and services may contain links to other websites, applications, platforms and services maintained by third parties. Salesforce does not control these and the information practices of those third parties, including the social media platforms that host our branded social media pages, are governed by their own privacy statements. It is recommended that you read the applicable privacy statements carefully to understand their privacy practices.
In some circumstances, we also collect, or our partners provide us with, publicly available information which may contain Personal Data that you have published or that has been made available online. The way in which our partners collect this is detailed in their own privacy statements, available on their websites.
Salesforce may use artificial intelligence to process your Personal Data, including to develop and deploy AI systems. Where artificial intelligence is leveraged, it will only be used where legally permissible, in compliance with this Privacy Statement, and in a manner which is consistent with our commitments and values. More information on Salesforce’s responsible AI practices can be found [here.](https://www.salesforce.com/company/responsible-ai-and-technology/)
For the avoidance of doubt, this applies where Salesforce processes your Personal Data as a controller. It does not apply to Personal Data you voluntarily submit to our services as an authorised user of a Salesforce customer for which Salesforce always acts as a processor.

4.2 Our use of cookies, web beacons and other tracking technologies on our website and in email communications to you.
We use technologies such as web beacons, pixels, tags, and JavaScript, alone or in conjunction with cookies, to collect information about the use of our websites and how people interact with our emails.
When you visit our websites, we, or an authorized third party, may place a cookie on your device that collects information, including Personal Data, about your online activities over time and across different sites. Cookies allow us to track use, infer browsing preferences, and improve and customize your browsing experience.
We use both session-based and persistent cookies on our websites. Session-based cookies exist only during a single session and disappear from your device when you close your browser or turn off the device. Persistent cookies remain on your device after you close your browser or turn your device off. To change your cookie settings and preferences for one of our websites, navigate to the “Cookie Preferences” link available in any salesforce.com website footer to choose your settings. You can also control the use of cookies on your device, but choosing to disable cookies on your device may limit your ability to use some features on our websites and services.
We also use web beacons and pixels on our websites and in emails. For example, we may place a pixel in a marketing email that notifies us when you click on a link in the email. We use these technologies to operate and improve our websites and marketing emails – please see more details in the “Advertising Cookies” row in the table below. For instructions on how to unsubscribe from our marketing emails, please see Section 10.4 below.
The following describes how we use different categories of cookies and similar technologies, and details your options for managing the data collection settings of these technologies:
##  Options for Managing Data Collection Settings 
**Type of Cookies** | **Description** | **Managing Settings**  
---|---|---  
**Required cookies** | Required cookies are necessary for basic website functionality. Some examples include: session cookies needed to transmit the website, authentication cookies, and security cookies.  
  
If you have chosen to identify yourself to us, we may place on your browser a cookie that allows us to uniquely identify you when you are logged into the websites and to process your online transactions and requests. |    
Because required cookies are essential to operate the websites, there is no option to opt out of these cookies.  
**Functional cookies** | Functional cookies enhance functions, performance, and services on the website. Some examples include: cookies used to analyze site traffic, cookies used for market research, and cookies used to display advertising that is not directed to a particular individual.   
  
Functional cookies may also be used to improve how our websites function and to help us provide you with more relevant communications, including marketing communications. These cookies collect information about how our websites are used, including which pages are viewed most often.  
  
We may use our own technology or third-party technology to track and analyze usage information to provide enhanced interactions and more relevant communications, and to track the performance of our advertisements.  
  
Salesforce may also use HTML5 local storage or Flash cookies for the above-mentioned purposes. These technologies differ from browser cookies in the amount and type of data they store, and how they store it. | We need your prior consent to use functional cookies. To change your cookie settings and preferences, including those for functional cookies, click the Cookie Preferences link in the footer of the page.  
  
To learn how to control functional cookies via your individual browser settings, click [her](http://www.aboutcookies.org/)[e](http://www.aboutcookies.org/).

**Advertising cookies** | Advertising cookies track activity across websites in order to understand a viewer’s interests and to direct marketing to them.   
  
We sometimes use cookies delivered by us or by third parties to show you ads for our services that we think may interest you on devices you use and to track the performance of our advertisements. For example, these cookies collect information such as which browser you used when visiting our websites.  
  
Salesforce also contracts with third-party advertising networks that collect IP addresses and other information from web beacons on our websites, from emails and on third-party websites. Advertising networks follow your online activities over time and across different websites or other online services by collecting certain data through automated means, including through the use of cookies. These technologies may recognize you across the different devices you use. When we work with third party advertising networks, we require them to restrict their data processing to only what is necessary to provide us with the advertising services we request. |    
We need your prior consent to use of targeting and advertising cookies. To change your cookie settings and preferences, including those for targeting and advertising cookies, click the Cookie Preferences link in the footer of the page.  
  
See Section 4.3, below, to learn more about these and other advertising networks and your ability to opt out of collection by certain third parties.

While some internet browsers offer a “do not track” or “DNT” option that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked, these features are not yet uniform and there is no common standard adopted by industry groups, technology companies, or regulators. Therefore, we do not currently commit to responding to browsers’ DNT signals with respect to our websites. Salesforce takes privacy and meaningful choice seriously and will continue to monitor developments around DNT browser technology and the implementation of a universal standard.
4.5 Social Media Features
Our websites may use social media features, such as the “Post” button and other sharing widgets (“Social Media Features”). Social Media Features may allow you to post information about your activities on our website to outside platforms and social networks. Social Media Features may also allow you to like or highlight information we have posted on our website or our branded social media pages. Social Media Features are either hosted by each respective platform or hosted directly on our website. To the extent the Social Media Features are hosted by the platforms themselves, and you click through to these from our websites, the platform may receive information showing that you have visited our websites. If you are logged in to your social media account, it is possible that the respective social media network can link your visit to our websites with your social media profile.
Salesforce also allows you to log in to certain of our websites using sign-in services. These services authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain Personal Data from these services with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign-up form.
Your interactions with Social Media Features and their uses of your Personal Data are governed by the privacy statements of the companies providing these features Salesforce has no control over these.
4.6 Telephony log information
If you use certain features of our services on a mobile device, we may also collect telephony log information (like phone numbers, time and date of calls, duration of calls, SMS routing information and types of calls), device event information (such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser language), and location information (through IP address, GPS, and other sensors that may, for example, provide us with information on nearby devices, Wi-Fi access points and cell towers).

##  Frequently asked questions 
###  What is digital labor? 
[Digital labor](https://www.salesforce.com/agentforce/digital-labor/) refers to technologies (such as AI automation and AI agents) that mimic human decision-making and cognitive abilities. It powers everything from lead nurturing to 24/7 customer support to campaign generation — extending human capacity at speeds and scales no human-only workforce can match.
###  What is an Agentic Enterprise? 
An [Agentic Enterprise](https://www.salesforce.com/agentforce/agentic-enterprise) is a company where humans and AI agents collaborate seamlessly. Employees are enhanced by digital labor to boost productivity, unlock insights, drive results, and strengthen every customer relationship through trusted, data-driven experiences. This requires a deeply unified platform to deliver efficiencies that scale and customer success that lasts.
###  What is the agentic era? 
The agentic era is a turning point in how work gets done. For the first time, AI doesn’t just respond to queries or perform simple repetitive tasks — it’s evolved to reason, adapt, and handle cognitive work once reserved for people. Employees gain digital partners that think, learn, and act alongside them — driving faster decisions, more personalized customer experiences, and productivity at a scale a human-only workforce could never achieve.
###  How can my business become an Agentic Enterprise? 
Becoming an Agentic Enterprise starts with a clear vision and team alignment around your goals. From there, identify your initial high-impact use cases, transform your existing processes for humans and agents to work together, and build a trusted, unified data foundation that provides a single source of truth for every decision.
By doing so, you can achieve the “dual dividend” of delighting customers and ensuring employee success. Additionally, it’s important to look towards the future by preparing for advanced multi-agent environments, robotics, and enterprise general intelligence (EGI). Learn how to get started in our step-by-step guide [here](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/playbook/agentic-ai/).
###  What is an AI agent? 
An [AI agent](https://www.salesforce.com/agentforce/ai-agents/) is an intelligent reasoning application that can use data and large language models to conduct planning, task execution, and conversations. An agent takes action based on a trigger, which can be changes in data, conversations, and scheduled automations. It then uses that trigger to determine a plan of action. The plan of action is determined by the predefined topics assigned to an agent. A topic is a job to be done, complete with the instructions and set of actions the agent can execute to achieve that goal. The agent then reasons through the query, selects a relevant topic, selects the action to take, and gathers the data required to execute. Agentforce is the platform where IT teams can define the following parameters for their AI agents.
###  Is Customer 360 a product? 
Customer 360 is not one specific product; it’s an end state we help our customers achieve by using the breadth of our portfolio. We offer apps for virtually every team within your organization, which means everyone — your employees _and_ AI agents — can take action on a 360-degree view and is united around the customer to manage and grow customer relationships.
###  How does Salesforce create a 360-degree view of my customer if our data is living in silos and disparate systems? 
Disconnected data is a top barrier to great customer and employee experiences. Too often it sits in disconnected silos, cut off from the trusted source of truth your organization needs. The answer is [Data Cloud](https://www.salesforce.com/data/), which unifies all your data from any source into a comprehensive, trusted view of your business. [MuleSoft](https://www.salesforce.com/mulesoft/), the world’s #1 integration and API platform, connects data from anywhere (yes, even mainframes) so you can unite all your islands of data to get a complete view of your customers and business. And with our [Zero Copy Partner Network](https://www.salesforce.com/data/zero-copy-partner-network/), organizations can easily connect and use all their data within the [Salesforce Platform](https://www.salesforce.com/platform/) without needing to move or copy data between platforms.
Once your data is unified, [Tableau](https://www.salesforce.com/analytics/) helps to explore data, uncover patterns, and act on insights across your business. Together, our data solutions give employees and agents governed real-time intelligence — ensuring they only access the data they’re authorized to use — while still enabling more personalized experiences at every touchpoint.
###  What is Agentforce? 
[Agentforce](https://www.salesforce.com/agentforce/) is Salesforce’s groundbreaking suite of customizable agents and tools, deeply integrated with the [Salesforce Platform ](https://www.salesforce.com/platform/)that helps companies build, customize, and deploy autonomous agents to support employees and customers. With Agentforce, you can get out-of-the-box templates for quickly building and customizing AI agents that meet specific business requirements. These agents can also be personalized using familiar Salesforce tools, including prompt templates, Flows, and Apex. Agents are able to carry out business tasks using a company’s CRM data, external data, and metadata while adhering to strict privacy and security guidelines and action guardrails. Because these agents are completely integrated with your Customer 360 apps across sales, service, marketing, commerce, and more, they can seamlessly hand off to employees right in the flow of work. You can collaborate with your agents as a true extension of your team in any Salesforce app, partner app, or custom app you build.
###  I’m just looking to get started with CRM and don’t think I need AI solutions yet. Is Salesforce right for me? 
Yes. Our CRM apps are designed to meet you exactly where you are today and help you embrace the latest technologies. Some organizations may just need one of our market-leading CRM solutions to support a single department or business goal, while others may benefit from connecting more of their teams and data on an AI-powered CRM platform to manage customer relationships more holistically.
###  How do I know Salesforce can deliver results for my business? 
We’re proud of the results our customers see with Salesforce. But you don’t have to take our word for it. A customer survey completed in August 2025 revealed 97% of our customers achieved positive ROI with Salesforce and 98% were satisfied with Salesforce. On average, customers report a 34% faster response to customers, 33% faster decision-making, 33% faster collaboration, and 34% increase in employee productivity, among other metrics, across their entire Salesforce implementation. Read our [customer success stories](https://www.salesforce.com/customer-stories/) to learn more about the value Salesforce provides.
###  How is Salesforce priced? 
We offer a variety of pricing options for our customers, including:
Starter Suite, Pro Suite, or Foundation Suites: When you select a suite, you get a bundle of some of our most popular features in one package to create a Customer 360 out of the box across sales, service, marketing, commerce, and Data Cloud. Starter Suite is great for startups, whereas Foundations provides a more robust set of features for more established businesses.
Add-ons: Each add-on you select helps you customize your CRM solution to get exactly what your organization needs. We offer add-ons with different tiers of functionality, which is similar to how our editions have varying levels of functionality for most products.
To learn more, please visit the [Salesforce Product Pricing](https://www.salesforce.com/pricing/) page.
###  Is AI included in all Salesforce apps and solutions? 
Customers must purchase product-specific add-ons to take advantage of Agentforce and other generative AI capabilities embedded within Salesforce clouds. However, many predictive AI features are offered as add-ons to our standard cloud editions. [Get in touch](https://www.salesforce.com/form/einstein-gpt/contact-us/?d=pb) with our sales team to learn more.
###  Does Salesforce integrate with other applications? How? 
Salesforce CRM apps are deeply integrated, as they operate from one core platform with one metadata framework that creates a common language across apps. This means you can customize something in one app — for example, a custom object specific to your business like a “pet name” for an animal hospital or a “vehicle” for a car dealership — and that same customization can appear across every other app, automatically. In addition, Salesforce is open to external apps and technologies by design, because we never want to box our customers into solutions. Our platform is built to provide a seamless back-end experience with any external partner, model, data store, or productivity suite you currently use. We also operate a robust SaaS marketplace, AppExchange, where partners build custom apps to extend your use of Salesforce.
You can also integrate any system with Salesforce thanks to MuleSoft, the world’s #1 integration and API platform owned and operated by Salesforce. With the MuleSoft Anypoint Platform™, you can connect any system, application, data, and device to unleash the full power of the #1 AI CRM.
And we know how important unified data is to trusted AI, so we make it easy to bring in any external data to Salesforce with our [Zero Copy Partner Network](https://www.salesforce.com/data/zero-copy-partner-network/%20). Zero copy enables organizations to easily connect and use all of their data within the Salesforce Platform without needing to move or copy data between platforms. Learn more about zero copy [here](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/zero-copy/).
###  How are Salesforce AI solutions different from public generative AI models? 
Public generative AI models can do amazing things, but the model learns from everything you enter into your prompts. That’s why enterprise AI is different — you certainly can’t have public models learning from your sensitive customer data.
Salesforce helps you harness AI to deliver impactful customer experiences across your business with data privacy and security built in. Our Einstein Trust Layer prevents sensitive data from leaving the Salesforce trust boundary, so you can use AI in every app, across every user, and in every workflow across your CRM with confidence. Learn more about how [Salesforce AI ](https://www.salesforce.com/artificial-intelligence/)delivers trusted, extensible AI grounded in the fabric of our [Salesforce Platform](https://www.salesforce.com/platform/).

**By**[**Magulan Duraipandian**](https://www.salesforce.com/blog/author/magulan-duraipandian/), _Sr. AI Solutions Technical Evangelist_ - Salesforce
AI agents transform the way companies operate and interact with their customers. These intelligent systems are designed to automate complex tasks, provide personalized experiences, and free up human workers to tackle more demanding challenges.
##  AI agents defined 
AI agents are a type of [artificial intelligence (AI)](https://www.salesforce.com/artificial-intelligence/) system that can understand and respond to customer inquiries without human intervention. They are created using an [agent builder](https://www.salesforce.com/agentforce/agent-builder/), like [Agentforce](https://www.salesforce.com/agentforce/), and rely on [machine learning](https://www.salesforce.com/artificial-intelligence/what-is-machine-learning/) and [natural language processing (NLP)](https://www.salesforce.com/artificial-intelligence/nlp/) to handle a wide range of tasks. These intelligent agents can include anything from answering simple questions to resolving complex issues â€” even multi-tasking. Most importantly, they can continuously improve their own performance through self-learning. This is distinct from traditional AI, which requires human input for specific tasks.
##  AI agent key takeaways 
  * AI agents are more advanced and autonomous than chatbots, capable of learning and handling a wider range of complex tasks.
  * They offer significant business benefits, including increased efficiency, cost savings, and improved customer satisfaction.
  * AI agents have versatile applications and are built for specialized functions across various industries, such as sales, marketing, and finance.


##  The evolution of AI agents 
  * The concept of AI agents has been a subject of research for many years. While the idea of autonomous, intelligent systems has been around for decades, recent advancements in [large language models (LLMs)](https://www.salesforce.com/artificial-intelligence/what-are-large-language-models/) have provided a "missing component", making current capabilities more accessible and powerful. These advancements have allowed AI agents to move beyond theoretical discussions into practical, real-world applications.


##  How do AI agents work? 
AI agents operate through a process that mirrors human thought, allowing them to interact and solve problems autonomously. They begin by gathering data, then processing that information to make a decision, which they then act on. This entire cycle is continuously refined through learning and adaptation.
  * **Perception and data collection** : Agentic systems start by gathering data from a variety of sources including customer interactions, transaction histories, and social media. This data is crucial for understanding the context and nuances of customer queries. Advanced agentic AI can integrate and process data in real time, providing them with the most up-to-date information to handle inquiries effectively.
  * **Decision making** : Using sophisticated machine learning models, AI agents analyze the collected data to identify patterns and make decisions. For example, they can determine the most appropriate response to a customer query based on past interactions and the current context. This decision-making process is enhanced by the agent's ability to learn from previous experiences and refine its responses over time.
  * **Action execution** : Once a decision is made, digital assistants can execute the required action. This could involve answering a customer query, processing a request, or escalating a complex issue to a human. The execution is designed to be seamless and efficient, ensuring that customers receive timely and accurate responses.
  * **Learning and adaptation** : Agents continuously learn from each interaction, refining their algorithms to improve accuracy and effectiveness. They update their [knowledge base](https://www.salesforce.com/service/knowledge-base/article/) and use feedback to enhance future interactions. This continuous learning capability ensures that they remain effective and relevant, even as customer expectations and business environments change.


By combining these capabilities, intelligent systems can handle a wide range of tasks autonomously, such as making product recommendations, troubleshooting problems, and engaging in follow-up interactions. This allows humans to focus on complex tasks that add value.
##  Core Components and Architecture of AI Agents 
Understanding the internal workings of AI agents requires a look at their fundamental building blocks. These components enable agents to perceive, reason, and act effectively:
  * **Underlying Model (LLM)** : Large Language Models (LLMs) serve as the brain of many modern AI agents, providing the foundational natural language understanding and generation capabilities.
  * **Memory** : AI agents require various forms of memory to maintain context and learn over time. This can include:
    * **Short-term memory** : For immediate conversational context.
    * **Long-term memory** : For retaining knowledge and learning from past experiences.
    * **Episodic memory** : For remembering specific interactions or events.
    * **Consensus memory** : For shared knowledge within multi-agent systems.
    * Mechanisms like "chunking and chaining" are often used to manage and retrieve information efficiently from memory.
  * **Persona** : This component helps an AI agent maintain a consistent character, tone, and style throughout interactions, contributing to a more natural and predictable user experience.
  * **Tools** : To perform actions in the real world, AI agents need access to various external tools, APIs, and programs. These tools allow agents to retrieve information, execute commands, or interact with other systems.
  * **Agent Action:** The mechanism by which the AI Agent performs tasks and interacts with its environment. Actions can include calling external functions, invoking APIs, or controlling physical actuators.
  * [**Architecture**](https://www.salesforce.com/agentforce/agentic-architecture/): This refers to the overall structural design of the AI agent, encompassing its physical or software base. It defines how the different components interact and how data flows within the system.


##  Specific AI Agent Reasoning Paradigms 
Beyond the general operational loop, AI agents employ specific reasoning paradigms to handle complex, multistep problems:
  * **ReAct (Reasoning and Action)** : This paradigm allows an agent to interleave reasoning (e.g., internal monologue, planning) with actions (e.g., using tools, querying databases). This enables more dynamic and adaptable problem-solving.
  * **ReWOO (Reasoning WithOut Observation)** : In this approach, the agent performs its reasoning process without constantly observing the environment after each step, which can be more efficient for certain tasks.


These distinct architectural approaches allow agents to handle nuanced and complex scenarios more effectively than simpler systems.
##  AI agents vs. chatbots 
Chatbots and AI agents have different jobs. [Chatbots](https://www.salesforce.com/agentforce/chatbot/) are usually designed for one specific task, like customer service or finding information. They follow rules and scripts, and they use pattern matching and keyword recognition to respond. This makes them good at handling simple questions, but they can't understand complex contexts or adapt to new situations.
AI agents, on the other hand, are more advanced and independent. They can handle a wider range of tasks, learn from interactions, and improve over time. Autonomous agents can understand and keep context across multiple conversations, making them suitable for more complex and dynamic environments. They can also integrate with different systems and platforms, performing tasks that require a deeper understanding of user needs and the environment.
For example, AI agent use cases include managing a user's calendar or making personalized recommendations, while a chatbot might only answer FAQs. The distinction is blurring, but AI agents generally possess more capabilities and autonomy.
###  AI agents vs. AI assistants 
While often used interchangeably, there's a nuanced difference. AI assistants, like Microsoft 365 Copilot, often work alongside users to augment their capabilities. AI agents can be seen as a step further, possessing higher levels of autonomy and the ability to proactively take actions to achieve goals, sometimes working in collaboration with or independently of human intervention. The key distinctions often lie in purpose, capabilities, interaction, autonomy, complexity, and learning.

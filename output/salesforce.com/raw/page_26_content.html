Subject to the restrictions set forth below and the payment of all applicable fees, Webider grants Customer a limited, non-exclusive, non- transferable, non-sublicensable right to download the Software for installation in Your salesforce.com instance (“SFDC Instance”) for use by You in connection with Your SFDC Instance for the number of users for which you have paid applicable subscription fees for Your internal business purposes. Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to the terms of this Agreement, Customer may access and use the Software on a trial basis and free of charge for a period not to exceed thirty (30) calendar days (“Trial Period”), if available or offered.

Software Availability. You acknowledge that access to and use of the Software is dependent on the availability and proper functioning of Your SFDC Instance and that Webider has no control over your SFDC Instance or the salesforce.com service. Webider disclaims responsibility and liability for any inability to access or use the Software, or degradation of the performance of the Software, to the extent caused by issues, problems, or\n\nmalfunctions of, or inaccessibility to, Your SFDC Instance or other third party owned or controlled technology. You are solely responsible for the configuration of Your SDFC Instance and all technology and services necessary to access and use the Internet and Your SFDC Instance.\n4.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither party bears responsibility for safeguarding information that is publicly available without breach of an obligation owed to the disclosing party hereunder, obtained from third parties not under confidentiality restrictions, independently developed or known to the recipient without breach of an obligation owed to the disclosing party, or required to be disclosed by order of court or other governmental entity. If either party breaches, or threatens to breach the provisions of this Section 10, each party agrees that the non-breaching party will have no adequate remedy at law and is therefore entitled to immediate injunctive and other equitable relief. The Customer agrees to share the data automatically on total number of active users in the org, license active status, activation date, disable date, and license validation date with Webider to match the appropriate license tier for the application package to your org.\n11. Customer Warranties. Customer shall be solely responsible for all activities in connection with the Software that occur under Customer’s username(s). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Customer shall: (i) comply with all applicable laws and regulations; and (ii) be solely responsible for the accuracy, reliability, and quality of any information or data submitted by Customer to Webider or processed using the Software. Customer warrants that any data, content, or materials used, stored or created by Customer using the Software will not infringe the copyright, trade secret, patent, privacy, publicity, or other proprietary or intellectual property right of any third party.\n12. Breach of Customer Warranties. In the event of any breach, or reasonably anticipated breach, of any of Customer’s warranties or obligations, or Customer infringes or misappropriates Webider’ intellectual\n\nproperty rights, in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity, Webider will have the right to immediately, in Webider’ sole discretion, suspend Customer’s access to or use of the Software and/or terminate this Agreement, if deemed reasonably necessary by Webider to prevent any harm to Webider or its business.\n13. Indemnity.\n13.1 Customer shall indemnify and hold Webider and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, and employees harmless from any claims by third parties, and any related damages, losses or costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs), arising out of a claim or demand alleging that any data or content submitted by Customer to Webider infringes, misappropriates, or violates any rights of a third party including any third party intellectual property rights.\n13.2 If any action is instituted by a third party against You based upon a claim that the Software, as provided, infringes a United States patent, copyright or trademark, then Webider will defend such action at its own expense on behalf of You and will pay all damages attributable to such claim which are finally awarded against You or paid in settlement of such claim. Webider may, at its option and expense, and as Your exclusive remedy hereunder: (a) procure for You the right to continue using the Software; (b) replace or modify the Software so that it is no longer infringing but continues to provide comparable functionality; or (c) terminate this Agreement and Your access to the Software and refund any amounts previously paid for the Software attributable to the remainder of the then- current term of this Agreement. Webider will have no liability to You for any infringement action that arises out of a breach of the terms and conditions of this Agreement by You or of the use of the Software (i) after it has been modified by You or a third party without Webider’ prior written consent, or (ii) in combination with any other service, equipment, software or process not provided by Webider where the combination is the basis for the infringing activity. This Section sets forth the entire obligation of Webider and Your exclusive remedy against Webider or any of its suppliers for any infringement claim.\n14. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER.

CUSTOMER ASSUMES ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR SELECTION OF THE SOFTWARE TO ACHIEVE ITS INTENDED RESULTS AND FOR THE USE OF AND RESULTS OBTAINED FROM THE SOFTWARE.

WEBIDER DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE SOFTWARE WILL MEET CUSTOMER’S REQUIREMENTS, BE UNINTERRUPTED, OR ERROR- FREE.\n15. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. EXCEPT FOR WEBIDER’S OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTION 13.2, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL WEBIDER, ITS LICENSORS, OR SALESFORCE.COM BE LIABLE FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, BUSINESS OR DATA (EVEN IF THE SAME WERE JUDGED BY A COURT TO BE DIRECT LOSSES) OR FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF BUSINESS INFORMATION OR OTHER SUCH PECUNIARY LOSS), WHETHER BASED ON BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, PRODUCT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. THE ABOVE WARRANTY DISCLAIMER AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY AND DAMAGES INURE TO THE BENEFIT OF WEBIDER’S LICENSORS AND SALESFORCE.COM.\n16. Survival.

General. This Agreement shall be governed by Texas law without giving effect to any conflicts of laws principles that require the application of the law of a different jurisdiction, and any disputes, actions, claims or causes of action arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the Service shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in Irving, Texas, USA.

Introduction and Acceptance. This Access License Agreement (the “Agreement”) is a legal agreement between you (either an individual or an entity) (“You” or “Customer”) and Webider, Corp. (“Webider”) setting forth the terms and conditions under which Webider will grant You the right to access and use certain Webider software described in the accompanying or online documentation (“Software”). BEFORE YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, CAREFULLY READ THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE A CORPORATION, PARTNERSHIP LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY OR OTHER ENTITY, THEN THE PERSON SIGNING THIS AGREEMENT ON THE ENTITY’S BEHALF REPRESENTS THAT HE OR SHE IS AUTHORIZED TO SIGN FOR AND BIND THE ENTITY. IF YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO SIGN FOR AND BIND THE ENTITY, THEN DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE SOFTWARE. BY CLICKING “I ACCEPT” BELOW, YOU ARE SIGNING THIS AGREEMENT, AND ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY AND ARE BECOMING A PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT.\n2. Software. Subject to the restrictions set forth below and the payment of all applicable fees, Webider grants Customer a limited, non-exclusive, non- transferable, non-sublicensable right to download the Software for installation in Your salesforce.com instance (“SFDC Instance”) for use by You in connection with Your SFDC Instance for the number of users for which you have paid applicable subscription fees for Your internal business purposes. Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to the terms of this Agreement, Customer may access and use the Software on a trial basis and free of charge for a period not to exceed thirty (30) calendar days (“Trial Period”), if available or offered. Customer’s access to the Software will automatically terminate following such Trial Period unless Customer has paid in full all applicable fees in accordance with this Agreement.\n3. Software Availability. You acknowledge that access to and use of the Software is dependent on the availability and proper functioning of Your SFDC Instance and that Webider has no control over your SFDC Instance or the salesforce.com service. Webider disclaims responsibility and liability for any inability to access or use the Software, or degradation of the performance of the Software, to the extent caused by issues, problems, or\n\nmalfunctions of, or inaccessibility to, Your SFDC Instance or other third party owned or controlled technology. You are solely responsible for the configuration of Your SDFC Instance and all technology and services necessary to access and use the Internet and Your SFDC Instance.\n4. Ownership.\n4.1 The rights granted hereunder do not constitute a transfer or sale of Webider’ or its licensors’ ownership rights in or to the Software, including, without limitation: (a) the Software and the applicable documentation; (b) Webider name, logo, domain name, Webider product names and other trademarks; and (c) hardware, processes, algorithms, user interfaces, know-how and other trade secrets or technology (collectively, “Webider Technology”).

Except for the rights granted above, Webider and its licensors retain all right, title and interest in and to Webider Technology, including all intellectual property rights therein.\n4.2 As between Webider and You, You own the information in Your SFDC Instance and Webider makes no claim of ownership to any information in Your SFDC Instance. You acknowledge and agree that the Software will access and use Customer information from your SFDC instance, but solely to the extent necessary for the Software to perform as intended.

The first monthly fee shall start to accrue as of the first day immediately following the Trial Period. The fees do not include any taxes or duties of any kind, which may be imposed by any governmental entity on the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Customer shall be solely responsible for all such taxes other than taxes based solely on Webider’ income. All amounts paid are non-refundable. Customer may purchase additional user licenses at any time on a pro-rata basis so that all licenses will have the same expiration date. All amounts are quoted in and must be paid in US dollars. In addition to any other rights granted to Webider herein, Webider reserves the right to suspend your access to and use of the Software if you fail to pay any undisputed amount owed on or before its due date.\n7. Term.\n7.1 If Customer subscribes to the Software with an annual contract, the initial term of this Agreement shall be 1 year from the date of first access by Customer. This contract shall automatically renew for additional successive 1-year terms at the Webider then-current list price unless terminated by either party upon 30 days notice prior to the expiration of the current term.\n\n7.2 If Customer subscribes to the Software with a monthly subscription, the initial term of this Agreement shall be the number of days remaining in the current month from the date of subscription. This subscription will automatically renew every month for additional successive 1-month terms at the Webider then-current list price unless terminated by either party or canceled by the customer via the AppExchange.\n8. Termination. Either party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement in the event of a breach by the other party, which breach has not been cured within 30 days of the receipt of written notice thereof, except in the case of Customer’s failure to pay any fees when due hereunder, which must be cured within 5 days after receipt of written notice from Webider. Either party may terminate this Agreement if the other party becomes the subject of an involuntary petition in bankruptcy or other proceeding relating to insolvency, receivership, or liquidation if such petition is not dismissed within 60 days of filing. Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, the rights granted to Customer hereunder will immediately terminate and Customer shall immediately discontinue any use of the Software. Termination shall not relieve Customer of the obligation to pay any fees accrued or payable to Webider prior to the effective date of termination. Termination will not result in any refund to the customer of fees paid.\n9. Support; Updates. Webider will provide email support to Customer for current versions of the Software. Webider will investigate all of Customer’s questions and problems promptly. Customer agrees to provide adequate information to Webider to assist in the investigation and to confirm that any problems have been resolved. Webider does not provide guaranteed response time but will make a good faith effort to answer emails within forty-eight (48) hours or less during weekdays, excluding holidays.\nWebider does not offer any support services under this Agreement. Webider may, in its sole discretion, from time to time update the Software and may include such updates, free of charge, in the Software, provided Customer has paid all applicable fees then due hereunder.\n10. Confidentiality. “Confidential Information” means information disclosed by either party to the other, whether orally, electronically or in writing, which is designated as confidential or would reasonably be considered to be\n\nconfidential under the circumstances by a reasonable person. Webider’ “Confidential Information” shall include, but not be limited to, Software, documentation, technology and technical information, product designs and business processes. Each party agrees to use Confidential Information solely to perform obligations and exercise rights under this Agreement and not to disclose, or permit to be disclosed, either directly or indirectly, Confidential Information to any third party without the other’s prior written consent. Each party shall safeguard the Confidential Information of the other party using the same measures it uses to protect its own confidential information but in no event less than reasonable care. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither party bears responsibility for safeguarding information that is publicly available without breach of an obligation owed to the disclosing party hereunder, obtained from third parties not under confidentiality restrictions, independently developed or known to the recipient without breach of an obligation owed to the disclosing party, or required to be disclosed by order of court or other governmental entity. If either party breaches, or threatens to breach the provisions of this Section 10, each party agrees that the non-breaching party will have no adequate remedy at law and is therefore entitled to immediate injunctive and other equitable relief. The Customer agrees to share the data automatically on total number of active users in the org, license active status, activation date, disable date, and license validation date with Webider to match the appropriate license tier for the application package to your org.\n11. Customer Warranties. Customer shall be solely responsible for all activities in connection with the Software that occur under Customer’s username(s). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Customer shall: (i) comply with all applicable laws and regulations; and (ii) be solely responsible for the accuracy, reliability, and quality of any information or data submitted by Customer to Webider or processed using the Software. Customer warrants that any data, content, or materials used, stored or created by Customer using the Software will not infringe the copyright, trade secret, patent, privacy, publicity, or other proprietary or intellectual property right of any third party.\n12. Breach of Customer Warranties. In the event of any breach, or reasonably anticipated breach, of any of Customer’s warranties or obligations, or Customer infringes or misappropriates Webider’ intellectual\n\nproperty rights, in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity, Webider will have the right to immediately, in Webider’ sole discretion, suspend Customer’s access to or use of the Software and/or terminate this Agreement, if deemed reasonably necessary by Webider to prevent any harm to Webider or its business.\n13. Indemnity.\n13.1 Customer shall indemnify and hold Webider and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, and employees harmless from any claims by third parties, and any related damages, losses or costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs), arising out of a claim or demand alleging that any data or content submitted by Customer to Webider infringes, misappropriates, or violates any rights of a third party including any third party intellectual property rights.\n13.2 If any action is instituted by a third party against You based upon a claim that the Software, as provided, infringes a United States patent, copyright or trademark, then Webider will defend such action at its own expense on behalf of You and will pay all damages attributable to such claim which are finally awarded against You or paid in settlement of such claim. Webider may, at its option and expense, and as Your exclusive remedy hereunder: (a) procure for You the right to continue using the Software; (b) replace or modify the Software so that it is no longer infringing but continues to provide comparable functionality; or (c) terminate this Agreement and Your access to the Software and refund any amounts previously paid for the Software attributable to the remainder of the then- current term of this Agreement. Webider will have no liability to You for any infringement action that arises out of a breach of the terms and conditions of this Agreement by You or of the use of the Software (i) after it has been modified by You or a third party without Webider’ prior written consent, or (ii) in combination with any other service, equipment, software or process not provided by Webider where the combination is the basis for the infringing activity. This Section sets forth the entire obligation of Webider and Your exclusive remedy against Webider or any of its suppliers for any infringement claim.\n14. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER.

Customer warrents that Customer owns all right, title and interest in and to the Customer Data. If a third party asserts a claim against Company asserting that the Customer Data or Customer’s use of the Online Services in violation of this Agreement violates that third-party’s intellectual property rights, rights on its personal data or otherwise harms the third party (“Claim”), Customer will, at its own expense: (a) defend or settle this third party’s Claim; and (b) indemnify Company for any damages finally awarded against Company based on that Claim.\n7.5. Company will use the Customer Data only as necessary to provide the Online Services in accordance with this Agreement. Customer is responsible for loading and/or transferring Customer Data into the Online Services through the use of Software functionnalities and for ensuring that such transfer is completed.\n7.6. Customer may choose to implement some Software functionalities using internet publically accessible URL as described in the Documentation. These URLs use a tokenization technique so that it is not possible to deduce other URLs from an URL. It is the Customer’s responsibility to take organizational and informational measures for its Users if the Customer does not want these URLs to be communicated to third parties. Any action, claim or demand, regardless of the basis on which it is asserted and regardless of the person or entity from whom it is asserted, against the Company arising out of the use of an URL or the disclosure of Customer Data designated by the URL shall be deemed to be a \"Claim\" within the meaning of Article 7.3 and the provisions of that Section shall apply.\n7.7.

The Customer acknowledges that data not explicitly exported or recovered during the access period may be automatically and permanently deleted without notice, and that the Company shall not be held liable for the persistence or deletion of any residual data.\n(b) In the event of termination of Free Access at the initiative of the Company, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to delete Customer Data. However, no commitment is made regarding the timeframe for such deletion, and the Customer expressly waives any claim related to the persistence of test or inactive data, it being understood that data clean-up operations are carried out periodically and without guaranteed scheduling.\n(c) The Company shall not be liable for any loss, damage or claim arising from the loss, retention or destruction of Customer Data following the cessation of Free Access. The Customer remains solely responsible for exporting any data it wishes to retain prior to termination or discontinuation of use.\n\n8.\tTerm \n8.1. This Agreement is effective as of Customer’s acceptation as described in Article 1 and will remain in effect for the initial term specified in the Order (“Initial Term”).  \n8.2. After the Initial Term, the Agreement shall automatically renew for the same term (“Renewal Term”), unless either party notifies the other at least 30 days prior to the commencement of the Renewal Term that it does not intend to renew. Such notification must be made by registered mail with return receipt requested or by any other mail delivery service against receipt. If the notification of non-renewal is made by electronic mail, the notified party will remain free to accept or not the non-renewal. \n\n9.\tTermination\n9.1. Without limiting any rights of Company, this Agreement automatically terminates upon Customer violation of this Agreement.  \n9.2. Upon termination or expiration of this Agreement, Customer shall cease using the Software and the Online Services, and uninstall, remove, and destroy all copies of the Software, including, without limitation, the Documentation.\n9.3. Upon Customer’s request, the Company will provide unrestricted access to all data relative to the Customer usage of the Software stored on the Online Services including but not limited to all versions of images and/or files and sufficient metadata which would allow Customer to recreate the images/documents back into salesforce with minimal effort.  Company will then have the obligation to deliver a solution for this extraction and will assume the support around this solution. The Customer will have the responsibility to run and validate the export process. This process could be asked at any time during the Term (maximum one time every year and at the notification of Agreement termination) and within no later than 30 days after the expiration of this Agreement.  Company will provide the extraction solution within 30 days of the Customer’s request and will allow the Customer to choose the date of extraction in the following 30 days after this delivery.\n\n10.\tThird party providers services - Availability\n10.1. Some Software functionalities and the Online Services require the use of third party providers services. These third party providers services include: (i) content delivery networks (CDN), such as Heroku and Cloudinary; (ii) cloud hosting services, such as Amazon Web Services; and (iii) Salesforce. Company may decide to use other third party providers services at any time provided that it shall not materially affect the use of the Software and the Online Services.\n10.2. Customer agrees and acknowledges that Company will not provide any additional warranties or guarantees (whether actual or implied) relating to third party providers services outside what has been provided by said third parties to Company under their services level agreements. Such services level agreements are made available to Customer upon Customer’s request.\n10.3.

The Customer acknowledges and agrees that the Services provided by the Company rely on finite resources shared among multiple customers. To ensure service security, availability, and equitable resource distribution, the Company has implemented a Fair Use Policy (\"Fair Use Policy\") which is accepted by the Customer. \nFair Use Policy governs the acceptable use of resources within SharinPix’s image management solution and aims to guarantee fair, secure, and efficient Service for all customers while preventing disruptions caused by excessive API usage.\nThe Company’s API limits are a standard industry practice designed to:\n1.\tPrevent any single customer from monopolizing resources, thereby preserving system performance and integrity for all users.\n2.\tSafeguard against service degradation caused by excessive resource consumption by any customer.\n3.\tEnhance security by mitigating risks associated with prolonged data breaches or misuse at the customer’s end.\nFair Use Policy applies to all Customers and Users accessing SharinPix Services, including but not limited to access through the managed package, websites, and mobile applications. By using SharinPix Services, the Customer agrees to comply with the terms and conditions of the Fair Use Policy. These terms are integral to maintaining the system’s security, operational integrity and Service Level Agreements (SLA) for all Users.\nThe Company reserves the right to amend the Fair Use Policy at its sole discretion to address evolving operational or security needs. The latest version of the Policy is available at https://docs.sharinpix.com/a/1896527-sharinpix-fair-use-policy\n11.2. The Fair Use Policy applies in full to any Free Access. Company reserves the right to monitor usage and to suspend or limit access immediately, without notice or compensation, in case of excessive or abnormal use during Free Access. Such suspension shall not be considered a breach of the Agreement. Customer acknowledges and agrees that the Services provided by the Company rely on finite resources shared\n\n12.\tLimited Warranty, Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability.  \n12.1. Company warrants that the Software will perform substantially in accordance with Company's functional specifications published on the date of delivery to Customer, providing Customer uses the Software in accordance with this Agreement, the Documentation, and as otherwise directed by Company.  \n12.2. Company makes no warranties that the Software is error-free, that its use will be uninterrupted, or that it does not infringe on any other party’s intellectual property, nor any other warranties express or implied other than those expressly set forth herein.  \n12.3. Company's sole liability, and Customer's exclusive remedy for non conformity with the foregoing limited warranty, shall be, at Company's option, either (i) terminate this Agreement and issue a pro rata refund for any Fees paid in advance for licensing the Software, or (ii) repair or replacement of the affected Software.  \n12.4. Customer must notify Company promptly in writing of any non-conformity. This limited warranty is void if failure of the Software has resulted from modification, accident, abuse, or misapplication. Company disclaims any warranty or representation to any person other than Customer with respect to the Software. Company makes no other warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise. All implied warranties as to the satisfactory quality, performance, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose or noninfringement are expressly disclaimed to the maximum extent permitted by law.\n12.5. The total aggregated maximum liability of the Company relating to or based on the Agreement is limited to the highest of these amounts: (i) the sum that Customer has paid to Company according to the Agreement in the past 6 months until the occurrence of the event causing the liability or (ii) 6 times the average monthly amount paid during the past 12 months until the occurrence of the event causing liability.\n12.6. During any Free Access, the Software and Online Services are provided by SharinPix “as is” and “as available”. The Company makes no warranties that the Software is error-free, uninterrupted, or non-infringing. All warranties, whether express or implied, including but not limited to merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement, are expressly disclaimed. In no event shall the Company be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages (including but not limited to procurement of substitute services, loss of data, or business interruption), however caused and under any theory of liability, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n13.\tIndemnification by Customer  \n13.1. Customer shall indemnify and hold Company, its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, licensors, licensees, and vendors harmless from and against any and all claims, costs, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including attorneys' reasonable fees and costs) arising out of or in connection with:  (i) Software misuse or a violation of any other provision of this Agreement; (ii) a claim arising from the breach by Customer of this Agreement; (iii) any injury or damage to the person, property, or business of Company, its employees, agents, contractors, invitees, licensees, visitors, and/or customer(s)/end-user(s); (iv) any action brought against Company, as a result of Customer’s unauthorized or improper use, export, or re-export of the Software; or (v) claims arising from any infringement arising from the combination of the Software with any of the Customer’s products, service, hardware, content or business processes.\n13.2.

Customer shall immediately provide Company with written notice of any actual or threatened third party infringement claim regarding the goods or services purchased hereunder.  Failure to timely provide such notice shall relieve Company of any indemnity obligation hereunder. \n14.3. Company shall have sole control over the defense to such third party infringement claim, and Customer shall reasonably cooperate with Company in connection with such defense. In the event that the Software licensed hereunder is determined to be infringing, or in Company’s reasonable determination is likely to be found infringing by a court of competent jurisdiction, then Company shall (at its sole discretion) modify or replace the Software, in a non-infringing (but otherwise conforming) manner, or procure any required third-party license. If none of these alternatives are reasonably available, Company will terminate Customer's license to the Software and release Customer from its obligation to make future payments for the Software or issue a pro rata refund for any fees paid in advance.\n\n15.\tIntellectual Property Rights.  \nEach party shall retain all rights, title, and interest, in and to its patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, trade secrets, and any other intellectual property (“Intellectual Property”). Company expressly retains, without limitation, all rights, title, and interest to the Software and the Online Services and any improved, updated, modified or additional parts thereof.  Any Intellectual Property produced, conceived, or otherwise developed by or for Company hereunder shall be the exclusive property of Company.\n\n16.\tReference\nCustomer grants Company the right to use its trade name and/or its trademarks and/or its distinctive signs as a commercial reference in its press releases, company brochures, web sites, commercial presentations, trade fairs and conferences.\n\n17.\tPersonal Data\n17.1. Customer acknowledges that Company neither requires nor needs Customer to (i) send Company any personal data collected by Customer (“Personal Data”) or (ii) give Company access to any Personal Data. Customer remains responsible for either filtering, making anonymous, encrypting such Personal Data or for having proper procedures in place to prevent Personal Data from being sent to or accessed by Company.\n17.2. Customer is responsible for complying with all legal requirements, including applicable privacy laws and regulations (such as Regulation 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC ( “General Data Protection Regulation” or “GDPR”); California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”)), relating to the collection, use, processing and transfer of Personal Data. With regard to European Economic Area data protection laws (if applicable), Customer shall be considered the ‘data controller’, Company the ‘data processor’ and both parties shall fulfill their respective legal obligations.\n17.3. Company shall process Customer Personal Data for the sole purpose of enabling Customer to use Software functionalities and no other purposes. The parties agree that this Agreement (including the provision of instructions via the Software functionalities) constitute Customer’s documented instructions regarding Company’s processing of Personal Data.\n17.4. Company shall ensure that all personnel of Company granted access to personal data are under confidentiality obligations.\n17.5.

Company shall inform Customer of any intended changes to use the sub-processors listed in Article 10 concerning the addition or replacement of sub-processors, thereby giving the Customer the opportunity to object to such changes by notifying Processor promptly in writing. Customer's refusal of a new sub-processor may lead to a limitation of the functions of the Software without this being considered a breach of the Agreement by Company.\n17.9. As provided for in Article 10, the use of third party providers services may require the transfer of Personal Data to said third party services providers outside the European Union. By signing the Agreement, the Customer gives Company mandate to conclude with said third party services providers ‘standard contractual clauses’ as set out in the Commission Decisions (EU) 2021/94 or 2010/87.

Customer's refusal of a new sub-processor may lead to a limitation of the functions of the Software without this being considered a breach of the Agreement by Company.\n17.9. As provided for in Article 10, the use of third party providers services may require the transfer of Personal Data to said third party services providers outside the European Union. By signing the Agreement, the Customer gives Company mandate to conclude with said third party services providers ‘standard contractual clauses’ as set out in the Commission Decisions (EU) 2021/94 or 2010/87.

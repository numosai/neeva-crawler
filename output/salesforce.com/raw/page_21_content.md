**_*Do-It-Yourself (DIY) agentic AI_** _involves companies building and customizing their own AI systems that can act independently to achieve specific goals. Instead of relying on pre-built infrastructure and tools, these companies design, develop, and fine-tune AI agents to meet their unique needs, often using open-source resources and tools. This includes building models, integrating data, engineering prompts, and building guardrails and data security._
##  Research methodology 
Valoir conducted in depth interviews with more than twenty Salesforce customers representing a range of industries, company sizes, and geographies. All had experimented with some form of generative AI to build their own agentic apps before Agentforce was released, and were piloting Agentforce or using it in production.
